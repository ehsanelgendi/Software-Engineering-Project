" My team got handed over some server side code (in Java) that generates random tokens and I have a question regarding the same - The purpose of these tokens is fairly sensitive - used for session id, password reset links etc. So they do need to be cryptographically random to avoid somebody guessing them or brute force them feasibly. The token is a ""long"" so it is 64 bits long. The code currently uses the java.util.Random class to generate these tokens. The documentation ([http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Random.html][1]) for java.util.Random clearly states the following: Instances of java.util.Random are not cryptographically secure. Consider instead using SecureRandom to get a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator for use by security-sensitive applications. However, the way the code is currently using java.util.Random is this - It instantiates the java.security.SecureRandom class and then uses the SecureRandom.nextLong() method to obtain the seed that is used for instantiating the java.util.Randomclass. Then it uses java.util.Random.nextLong() method to generate the token. So my question now - Is it still insecure given that the java.util.Random is being seeded using java.security.SecureRandom? Do I need to modify the code so that it uses java.security.SecureRandom exclusively to generate the tokens? Currently the code seed's the Random once at startup",=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11051205/difference-between-java-util-random-and-java-security-securerandom/11060526,=https://lonelycoding.com/difference-between-java-util-random-and-java-security-securerandom/,=https://www.owasp.org/images/5/53/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_v2.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" My company has been evaluating Spring MVC to determine if we should use it in one of our next projects. So far I love what I've seen, and right now I'm taking a look at the Spring Security module to determine if it's something we can/should use. Our security requirements are pretty basic; a user just needs to be able to provide a username and password to be able to access certain parts of the site (such as to get info about their account); and there are a handful of pages on the site (FAQs, Support, etc) where an anonymous user should be given access. In the prototype I've been creating, I have been storing a ""LoginCredentials"" object (which just contains username and password) in Session for an authenticated user; some of the controllers check to see if this object is in session to get a reference to the logged-in username, for example. I'm looking to replace this home-grown logic with Spring Security instead, which would have the nice benefit of removing any sort of ""how do we track logged in users?"" and ""how do we authenticate users?"" from my controller/business code. It seems like Spring Security provides a (per-thread) ""context"" object to be able to access the username/principal info from anywhere in your app... Object principal = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal(); ... which seems very un-Spring like as this object is a (global) singleton, in a way. My question is this: if this is the standard way to access information about the authenticated user in Spring Security, what is the accepted way to inject an Authentication object into the SecurityContext so that it is available for my unit tests when the unit tests require an authenticated user? Do I need to wire this up in the initialization method of each test case? protected void setUp() throws Exception {    ...    SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(        new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(testUser.getLogin(), testUser.getPassword()));    ...} This seems overly verbose.

" These may be phrased as separate questions for clarity, but they are all related to the same issue. How are SSL certificate server names resolved? Why do browsers seem to use the CN field of the certificate, but Java's mechanism seem to only look at ""subject alternative names"" only? Is it possible to add alternative names to a SSL certificate using keytool?If not, is using openSSL instead a good option?? Just a little background: I need to get a main server to communicate with several servers using HTTPS. Obviously, we don't want to buy SSL certificates for every server (there could be many), so I want to use self-signed certificates (I have been using keytool to generate them). After I add the certificates as trusted in the OS, the browsers (IE and Chrome) happily accept the connection as trusted. However, even after adding the certificates to Java's cacerts, Java still won't accept the connection as trusted and throws the following Exception: Caused by: java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative names present at sun.security.util.HostnameChecker.matchIP(HostnameChecker.java:142) at sun.security.util.HostnameChecker.match(HostnameChecker.java:75) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.X509TrustManagerImpl.checkIdentity(X509T rustManagerImpl.java:264) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.X509TrustManagerImpl.checkServerTrusted( X509TrustManagerImpl.java:250) at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.ClientHandshaker.serverCertificate(Clien tHandshaker.java:1185) ... 14 more I found that I can make Java trust the certificate implementing my own HostNameVerifier, which I copied from here: com.sun.jbi.internal.security.https.DefaultHostnameVerifier just to test (by the way, the hostname passed as an argument to the HostnameVerifier is correct, so I think it should have been accepted).

" I'm deploying an application using JAWS, and it worked until late 2013 when I got a warning, and then this morning Java completely blocked it. The message in French is: Application bloqu•À_•À_e par les param•À_•À_tres de s•À_•À_curit•À_•À_ Vos param•À_•À_tres de s•À_•À_curit•À_•À_ ont bloqu•À_•À_ l'ex•À_•À_cution d'une application auto-sign•À_•À_e avec une version obsolete ou arriv•À_•À_e ‚_‚_ expiration de Java. which would translate roughly as: Application blocked by the security settings Your security settings have blocked from running an application that has been self-signed with an obsolete or outdated Java. The grammar is not that clear, the end of the sentence could be read as either: ...blocked a self-signed application from running with an obsolete or outdated Java [runtime], meaning that the local runtime is too old, but the self-signature is fine ...blocked an application that has been self-signed with an obsolete or outdated Java [compiler], meaning that the Java compiler used is too old I searched online for the exact same message in English, but I couldn't find it. So the grammar is still unclear. Note that on the message there is no Name: xyz / From: http://url/, there's only the text I typed above, and a blue ""i"" icon. Now, I don't really understand the exact meaning of this error message, but I know that there is an issue because my JAR files are all self-signed. I have already faced this on other Windows clients, and it was easy: I extracted a .cer certificate from my keystore; Downloaded it on the client machine, open it; Made the customers install it as a trusted source on their local machine. It worked like a charm on my test setup and for one customer, but another one still has the issue and cannot run my software. This is a big issue from me, and I don't know what to do. Should I upgrade my Java compiler, recompile everything, sign every JAR file again and cross fingers?

" I've been trying to get some working Java code to use for encrypting Paypal buttons. This is no easy task! Even when I get some code, from Paypal, I'm faced with errors..ugh..

Note: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_22 is set as %JAVA_HOME% 4) Updated system classpath to include location of jars. Note: There are other files, that came with the JDK 1.6 within the security folder, including : java.policy, java.security, javaws.policy, trusted.libraries - but those probably have nothing to do with the JCE files, right? Edit 6/23/2011 - results after further configuration I went to Bouncy Castle page at http://www.bouncycastle.org/specifications.html#install Scroll down to 5.0 Bouncy Castle Provider then read info under 5.1 Example. It makes mention of adding a parameter for the Bouncy Castle Provider to the java.security file. My file is under C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_22\jre\lib\security. I added the following line to my file - security.provider.10=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider In addition, I discovered that I hadn't added the Bouncy Castle jars to the classpath, so I went ahead and did so. Now after making these changes, recompiling and attempting to execute ClientSide.java I'm given the same exception : but maybe the focus should be on the part of the exception where it says this about bouncycastle provider - at org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JDKPKCS12KeyStore.cryptData(Unknown Source)at org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JDKPKCS12KeyStore.engineLoad(Unknown Source) @PeteyB - I'm certain that I installed the policy files correctly.

" I've been looking around and the closest answer is : How to generate a random alpha-numeric string? I want to follow this workflow according to this CrackStation tutorial: To Store a Password Generate a long random salt using a CSPRNG. Prepend the salt to the password and hash it with a standard cryptographic hash function such as SHA256. Save both the salt and the hash in the user's database record. To Validate a Password Retrieve the user's salt and hash from the database. Prepend the salt to the given password and hash it using the same hash function. Compare the hash of the given password with the hash from the database. If they match, the password is correct. Otherwise, the password is incorrect. I don't know how to generate a SALT. I figured out how to generate a hash using the MessageDigest. I tried using SecureRandom but nextByte method produces garbled code. Edit: I don't know which answer to choose, they're too complicated for me, I have decided to use jBCrypt; jBCript is easy to use, does all the complex stuff behind the scenes. so I'll let the community vote up for the best answer.",=https://stackoverflow.com/q/18142745,=https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm,=https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/41617/do-salts-have-to-be-random-or-just-unique-and-unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" I have a Spring MVC application.It uses its own custom Login page. Upon successful login, a 'LOGGED_IN_USER' object is placed in the HTTPSession. I want to allow only authenticated users to access URLs. I know i can achieve this by using a web filter. But, This part i want to do using Spring Security (my check will remain the same - look for 'LOGGED_IN_USER' object in HTTPSession, if present you are logged in). My constraint is i cannot change Login behavior at present - that will not use Spring Security yet. What aspect of Spring Security can i use to achieve this part alone - check if the request is authenticated (from logged in user)?

" I have gone through the OWASP top ten vulnerabilities and found that Cross-Site Scripting is the one we have to take notes. There was few way recommended solutions. One has stated that Do not use ""blacklist"" validation to detect XSS in input or to encode output. Searching for and replacing just a few characters (< and > and other similar characters or phrases such as script) is weak and has been attacked successfully. Even an unchecked ‚_‚_‚_<b>‚_‚_ tag is unsafe in some contexts. XSS has a surprising number of variants that make it easy to bypass blacklist validation.

" So here is the problem. When a user logs out of my website, they can still hit the back button and continue using the site. To keep track of whether the user is logged in or not, I created a session attribute ""isActive"". The attribute is set to true when the user logs in, and is (redundantly) removed right before the session is invalidated at logout. Also on every page I check if the attribute is present. I also specify that pages should not be cached in their head tags. Despite this users are still able to hit back on the browser, and continue to use the site as if they never logged off. Any idea on how to fix this? Here is the code: Login Servlet: ...session.setAttribute(""isActive"", true);//Redirect to home page. Check Logged In JSP: <c:if test='${empty sessionScope.isActive || sessionScope.isActive != true}'>     <c:redirect url=""/index.jsp?message=Session Timed Out.""/></c:if> Logout Servlet: request.getSession().removeAttribute(""isActive"");request.getSession().invalidate();response.sendRedirect(""index.jsp""); Inside Head Tag: <meta http-equiv=""Pragma"" content=""no-cache""><meta http-equiv=""Cache-Control"" content=""no-cache""><meta http-equiv=""Expires"" content=""Sat, 01 Dec 2001 00:00:00 GMT""> Thanks",//books.google.com/books?id=ZRNTDwAAQBAJ,=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3902688/how-to-properly-invalidate-jsp-session,=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Logout_and_Browser_Cache_Management_(OWASP-AT-007),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I can't believe I'm the only person to run up against this problem. I've been googling for hours and have not had any luck. The Java security documentation doesn't seem to address PKCS12 certificates thoroughly. I am trying to setup Java for user specific PKCS12 certificates. Among other things, this will be used so that, in Eclipse, I can access a Trac server that is authenticated via certificates. I am using the Trac Mylyn integration plugin for eclipse. Here is the setup: user home directories are at /home multiuser mount at /central each user has a personal certificate at: ~/user.p12 password for personal certificates is: pass1234 the users password is stored in a 0400 file at ~/password.txt a read-only trust store for the ca is at: /central/ca.jks no password for the truststore JDK 1.6 installed at /central/jdk_1.6.0 Eclipse 3.4 installed at /central/eclipse_3.4.0 JAVA_HOME=/central/jdk_1.6.0 JAVA_HOME is set to the JDK location because Eclipse needs this ECLIPSE_HOME=/central/eclipse_3.4.0 JRE lives at $JAVA_HOME/jre each user has a ~/.java.policy file there is a trac server running at https://trac.internal/trac the trac server authenticates using certificates Now, I want to be able to have each user simply modify some file that they own (like the ~/.java.policy file, for example), and be able to launch the central Eclipse application and access the Trac repository. Seems simple enough. Right now, the only way I can get this to work is to edit the $ECLIPSE_HOME/eclipse.ini file and add -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=""/home/user/user.p12""-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStoreType=""PKCS12""-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=""pass1234""-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=""/central/ca.jks"" Ok, that works, but there are two problems with it: Each user has to have their own ecipse install. (or can eclipse read that from a user file?) It is Eclipse specific, I'd ultimately like to have this as a Java configuration. Also, I remember from some time back that you can edit the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security file and add keystore=/home/user/user.p12keystore.type=PKCS12keystore.password=pass1234truststore=/central/ca.jks But Eclipse doesn't seem to pick that up. Could it be because my JAVA_HOME points to a JDK, and not the JDK's nested JRE? I've seen the Java PKCS#11 Reference that references the following properties:keyStoreURL=""NONE"" keyStoreType=""PKCS11"" keyStorePasswordURL=some_pin_url There was another reference I saw that said you could edit the ~/.java.policy file to include: keyStore ""file:///home/user/user.p12"", ""PKCS12"", ""SunJSSE"";keyStorePasswordUrl ""file:///home/user/password.txt""; But that doesn't get picked up either. Maybe it actually does work and its not getting read for the same reason the java.security file doesn't work, or maybe it just doesn't work at all. Some system properties I've seen: javax.net.ssl.keyStore=""/home/user/user.p12""javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType=""PKCS12""javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=""password""javax.net.ssl.keyStoreProvider=""SunJSSE""javax.net.ssl.trustStore=""/home/user/ca.jks""javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=""JKS""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=""""javax.net.ssl.trustStoreProvider=""Sun"" So, right now, I guess I'm stuck with having each user to have their own Eclipse intall. I know it sounds like a complicated setup, but this shouldn't really have anything to do with Eclipse as far as the certificate setup... its really a Java setup for user specific certificates.

For my School project I had to show that I can utilize file handling within a program. For this I made a very simple login process that you can create an account on that writes a username and password to a text file located in the resource folder. Obviously this has no security at all as it wasn't designed to be secure just to showcase file handling however my teacher has said that I should attempt to add some encryption to the file as well to get a better grade. I have done some research and many people are recommending DES. The problem I'm having is I don't have much time left for my project and need to finish it asap. Using DES seems like it would take a while to implement all the extra code. In my program I am using a simple lineNumberReader to read the files line by line. To write to the files I am using a BufferedWriter. Is there anyway to encrypt this data very simply? It doesn't have to be very secure but I need to show that I have atleast attempted to encrypt the data. The encryption and decryption would all be completed on the same application as data isn't being transferred. Potentially a way I can create a very simple encryption and decryption algorithm myself?,=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27962116/simplest-way-to-encrypt-a-text-file-in-java,=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27962116/simplest-way-to-encrypt-a-text-file-in-java%3Flq%3D1,=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/155372/creating-a-log-in-page-with-xampp-and-php/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" In my server (production server), I have a goDaddy ssl certificate. I have both iOS and Android apps connecting with the server, iOS connecting with no problems, android with versions 4.* everything is good, but with devices with 2.3.* I always get a SSLHandshakeException. I did exactly like on Android Developers page (https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl.html). I already saw similar threads here in stackoverflow (here) but none is helping. Then I saw this thread talking about Extended Key Usage, but when debugging I get the following information: [2]: OID: 2.5.29.37, Critical: falseExtended Key Usage: [ ""1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1"", ""1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2"" ] So I guess the certificate is not ""forcing"" Extended Key Usage. Also on this thread there are some other possible causes such as date/time being completly wrong, wich are all not existent. Taking that into consideration, I now don't know where the problem might be. Any suggestions?

" The question is, How to solve ""The certificate is not valid and cannot be used to verify the identity of this website"" error?. Here are the details: I have a signed applet that has been working fine, until I updated Java to 8u25 (1.8.0_25-b18). Now, the application shows an alert message ""Do you want to continue? The connection to this website is untrusted"". There is a note in this message too, ""The certificate is not valid and cannot be used to verify the identity of this website"". The applet is loaded without problems. But when the user tries to use a specific function of that application, the warning message is displayed. I've checked the java console when this happens, and this warning message is displayed right after these lines: security: Obtain certificate collection in SSL Root CA certificate storesecurity: Invalid certificate from HTTPS servernetwork: Cache entry not found [url: https://sub.domain.net:9876, version: null] The application is downloaded from a different domain, say ""https://app.domain.net/....."", so no jars are downloaded from ""https://sub.domain.net:9876"", but the applet connects to ""https://sub.domain.net:9876"" to send/receive data. The applet is signed correctly, and so far, it meets all the security requirements according to Java. This issue seems to happen when the application tries to connect internally with an HTTPS url like https://sub.domain.net:9876. That sites' SSL certificate is valid, issued by GoDaddy and has not expired. Again, this started to happen after updating my JRE to 8u25. I've tested adding the offending URL to Java security exception list, with no success. Here are a few screenshot of this problem: This is the warning message displayed: Edit 10/18/2014: Question posted in ""Oracle Community"" too, to increase answer options:Question in Oracle Community.

Downloading from ""sub.domain.net"" Expecting ""*.DOMAIN.NET"" This message says the application is BEING DOWNLOADED FROM ""sub.domain.com"", and that is false.

" There are three hosts that an android app do the authentication and authorization. Final host is the REST API.

But if user kills the app after login and accessing the services provided by REST API and then again open the app, this issue arise. In this time authentication and authorization process is not happening, only the REST API.

" We have a Java application that uses RxTx to update the firmware of our game console. To avoid security alerts when the users starts the Java application on our website through WebStart we have bought a trusted certificate and signed the application with that. All checks indicate that it is successfully signed and if I launch the application via Safari on my Mac(OS X 10.6.8) with Java 1.6.0_41 it starts without any complains. But if I launch it using IE9 on a Windows 8 machine I get an alert saying ""Do you want to run this application? This application will run with unrestricted access which may put your computer and personal information at risk. Run this application only if you trust the publisher. This application's digital signature has expired. More Information"". If I click the More Information I get ""This application will run with unrestricted access to your personal files and other facilities(webcam, microphone) on your computer. Although the application has a digital signature, the application's associated file(JNLP) does not have one. A digital signature ensures that a file is from the vendor and that it has not been altered. The digital signature was generated with a trusted certificate.""I have tried to find a solution how to not get this message and think what I need to do is sign the JNLP file(i.e. copy it into the jar as pointed out here) but what I cannot find is how to get NetBeans to do that!

" i have three java based web application app1,app2 and app3 at production. All 3 are verified by verified CA's and hosted on 3 different web servers and on https. app1,app2 is verified by secure trust.app3 is verified by trustwave . Below is the hierarchy of certificates of certificates ,i can see when i hit any of these app thru web browser. app1,app2 certificate hirerarchy is same .e  Entrust.net Secure Server Certification Authority---> SecureTrust CA------->*.myAppDomain.com app3 certificate hirerarchy is            Entrust.net Secure Server Certification Authority---> SecureTrust CA------->TrustWave Organization Validation CA, L------->*.myApp3.com Now when app1 connect to app2 , works fine.

I tried to found the entries for Entrust,SecureTrust,TrustWave but found only entries like entrustevca, entrust2048ca etc. So if i go by the logic that if root certificate (which is Entrust for both the applications app2 and app3 ) lies in trust store of contacting application(app3) ,which i can see in cacert file on app3 ,then i should not get the above mentioned error when app1 tries to contact app3 thru httpsURLConnection. I am not gettting the cause of this? i am not sure do we need to include the trustwave also , though the root certificate i.e Entrust which internally authenticate trustwave already there? If i need to include trustwave certificate(used by app2) in cacert file on app3 then by that logic i should also inlcude securetrust(used by app2) in cacert file on app3 but it is working Fine?",=https://stackoverflow.com/q/11239306,=http://brandee-ecdlutg.blogspot.com/2015/07/java-javaxnetsslsslhandshakeexception.html,=http://www.xbiao.tech/questions/913717/javax-net-ssl-sslhandshakeexception-sun-security-validator-validatorexception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" How to modify Java Control Panel selections (corresponding to deployment.properties file) from windows command prompt?Specifically, I am looking for command(s) which can effect change in ""Action for local applets"" selection, in ""Custom Security Level Settings"" window (click the ""Settings..."" button next to ""Custom"" setting for the ""Security Level"" slider in the Security tab in Java Control Panel), from ""Prompt user"" to ""Run without prompt"". This setting's default value changed with update 11 of Java 7 and it interferes with operation of an automated-test program, which I am fixing now, by having a Security Warning dialog window pop-up when IE starts java.exe, unless this Java Control Panel setting is adjusted a priori. This test program launches IE to run a local Java applet, which is written using AWT, and which doesn't access any websites. Note, this problem has been discussed recently -- see https://service.parachat.com/knowledgebase/273/I-see-a-Do-you-want-to-run-this-application-security-warning.html For my task, modifying this Java Control Panel setting manually is the least desirable way to solve the problem because the program, which I am fixing, is a part of an automated test suite, which is deployed on many machines, and requiring manual intervention makes the deployment process error-prone. I need these commands to run from a windows command prompt batch file. I found that these security level selections are recorded in Java deployment.properties file and in 2 Windows registry under keys with names ending in ""Software\JavaSoft\DeploymentProperties"".deployment.properties file is discussed comprehensively in Oracle Java SE Documentation ""Deployment Configuration File and Properties"" but nothing obvious is mentioned about ""Action for local applets"", maybe because this property is a recent addition (?)When I adjust Java Security Level and ""Action for local applets"" in the Java Control Panel, I see the changes reflected in the deployment.properties file as well as in the DeploymentProperties registry keys. So I can do the following: adjust the deployment.properties file via script (saving the original) start Java Control Panel via script -- I observed that this copies the updates from the deployment.properties file to the registry keys DeploymentProperties terminate the javaw process which runs the Java Control Panel then run the program which uses my local Java applet within IE then revert the deployment.properties file to the original, start Java Control Panel via script, and terminate the javaw process which runs the Java Control Panel. I also tried it vice versa -- update the registry key -- but the file does not change and Java Control Panel reverts the registry keys' value set back to agree with the unmodified deployment.properties file! So updating the registry keys is a wrong way to do it. Is there a better way to do this? My 3-step solution above (to modify the properties) is a kluge for what it is meant to accomplish. Is there a Java command-line utility which can modify a given deployment property? Is there a way to pass these deployment properties to JVM via applet tag's attributes, to be effective only within the given Java applet? I used Windows XP (both 32-bit and 64-bit) and Windows 7 (64-bit) and Internet Explorer 7, 8 and 9. It would be good to have a (simple) solution which works on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.",=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14403108/how-to-modify-java-control-panel-selections-corresponding-to-deployment-propert,=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/deploy/jcp.html,=http://www.labareweb.com/java-1-7-auto-update-deployment-with-sccmmdt/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
